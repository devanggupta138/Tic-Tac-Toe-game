## 📌 About the Project
This is a classic two-player Tic Tac Toe game where players take turns marking *X* and *O*.  
The game automatically detects *win conditions, **draw situations*, and allows restarting the game without refreshing the page.

This project was created as a *JavaScript practice mini-project* and is part of my front-end development learning journey.
